# Vanilla Neural Network Implementation

After fininshing my AI Course at Colorado College, I wanted to gain a better idea of what occurs
"Under the hood" of a Neural Network due to the time constraint of the bloack plan it was necessary to 
opt out of explaining neural networks in concrete detail in order to cover the necessary material in the 
syllabus. So over the fall break I decided to study Neural Networks concretely.

## Neural Network Import Requirements
 ```python
 # For scientific computation using numpy
import numpy as np
```
In this implementation I will only be using Numpy to create the Neural Network
I will include explanations and code snippets.
